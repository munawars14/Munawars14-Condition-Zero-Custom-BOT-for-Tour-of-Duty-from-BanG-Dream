<Br><br>
Same as Asuka, Marina is also an exclusive bot in Cost 1 because she uses the Spetsnaz character.

## Tactics
<Ul>
<Li>When hiring Cost 1 CT bot(s), hire Fair bot(s) first because they have better skill level.</li>
<li>On maps with large open space, bots with the M4A1, Famas, UMP-45, and the MP5 should be hired as they have better accuracy at longer ranges. Meanwhile at close ranged maps, bots with the M3, P90, TMP and the MP5 should be hired while the UMP-45 should be avoided.</li>
<Li>Rii is the only Cost 1 teammates who uses Leone 12 Gauge Super, so it's better for players to hire her only in melee type territorial (Office, Tides, etc.).</li>
<Li>Prioritize Marina as your teammate, she's the only one using M4A1.</li>
<Ul><Li>But will swap it for an CV-47 if she finds one dropped by a Terrorist, so it's better for players to hire her only in melee type territorial (Office, Tides, etc.) even though the shooting accuracy is low.</li></ul>
</Ul>

## Trivia
<Ul>
<Li>Rii is the only bot in Tour of Duty that uses Leone 12 Gauge Super as his most preferred weapon.</li>
<Ul><li>Other bots use Leone 12 Gauge Super when they can't buy XM1014.</li></ul>
<Li>Only Marina uses the M4A1.</li>
<Ul><li>She will use Famas if she can't buy M4A1.</li></ul>
<Li>Only Marina and Asuka use the exclusive character, Spetsnaz.</li>
<Li>Some CT bots have voice pitch higher than 110.</li>
