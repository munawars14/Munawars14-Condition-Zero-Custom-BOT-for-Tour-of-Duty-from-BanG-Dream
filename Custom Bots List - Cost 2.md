## Tactics
<Ul>
<Li>When hiring cost 2 bots, hire Arisa first because she have better skill (60 instead of 50) and preferred main weapons (Maverick M4A1 Carbine).</li>
<Li>When using Mayu in bomb defusal mission, she will camp at a bombsite. Therefore, she might be a good choice in defending open spaced bombsite (e.g. Aztec) on lower difficulties.</li>
<Li>Unless you have a lot of points to spend or have no more suitable candidate to join your team, it is best not to hire Hagumi, although her overall value looks higher than other mercenaries, but in fact the weapon she uses is the worst weapon of all cost 2 mercenaries: Schmidt Machine Pistol and the 9x19 Sidearm pistol, which is extremely bad weapons even though she use Tough template skill, which is completely incomparable with the powerful rivals of P90, AK47, AWP or M249.
<Ul>
<li>Even if she got a IDF Defender or CV-47, it might be difficult if she was hired on Normal difficulty and above.</li>
