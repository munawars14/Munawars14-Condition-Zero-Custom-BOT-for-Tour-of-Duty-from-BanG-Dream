## Tactics

<Ul>
<Li>When hiring cost 2 bots, hire Arisa first because she have better skill (60 instead of 50) and preferred main weapons (Maverick M4A1 Carbine). You can also hire Rokka after Arisa, because she have stronger preferred main weapons (Bullpup).</li>
<Ul>
<Li>You can change your teammate with Reona if one of the two suggestions doesn't match your preference or you can use them as their best companion.</li>
</Ul>
<Li>When using Mayu in bomb defusal mission, she will camp at a bombsite. Therefore, she might be a good choice in defending open spaced bombsite (e.g. Aztec) on lower difficulties.</li>
<Li>Unless you have a lot of points to spend or have no more suitable candidate to join your team, it is best not to hire Hagumi, although her overall value looks higher than other mercenaries, but in fact the weapon she uses is the worst weapon of all cost 2 mercenaries: KM UMP45 and the 9x19mm Sidearm pistol. KM UMP45 is not suitable for close range, 9x19mm Sidearm is also not suitable for longer range even though she use Tough template skill, which is completely incomparable with the powerful rivals of P90, AK47, AWP or M249.
<Ul>
<Li>If a SMG wielding teammates is really needed, consider hiring Himari instead even though she use Normal template skill and she uses the MP5 and is a all rounder decent weapon good for both medium and close ranged maps. Or hiring Mashiro who uses the ES C90 for close quarter combat for far better weapon.</li>
</Ul>
</Ul>

## Trivia

<Ul>
<Li>Sometimes bots don't use secondary weapons that match their map territory, especially Arisa, Nanami, Rokka, and Mashiro because they use secondary weapons randomly.</li>
<Li>Only Hagumi and Rui use the exclusive character, Spetsnaz.</li>
