## Overview
There are 10 Tour of Duty CT bots under Cost 3 category.

On Easy and Normal difficulty, they are unlocked after the player finished 8 maps (at 10 reputation points), while on Hard and Expert they are available from the beginning (they technically need 6 and 1 points respectively at these levels, but the starting reputation point level covers the costs). Three reputation points are needed to hire each of them. 10 of them uses Hard and VeryHard skill templates.

The order of the top weapons on the list becomes the bot's top priority.

#### Kaoru's Background
Seta Kaoru is a third-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and the guitarist of Hello, Happy World!
She is very popular with ladies, whom she dubs her "little kittens" (子猫ーちゃん, koneko-chan). Himari and Rimi in particular have a tendency of blushing in her presence.

Outside of the band, she is also Chisato's childhood friend, and their parents are good friends as well.

#### Kaoru's Personality
A flamboyant actress, Kaoru has an extravagant personality. She is rather pretentious and bombastic, having a tendency to use impressive-sounding words to the point of sounding foreign and hard to understand. She views herself as a prince and sees other girls as princesses, while quoting Shakespeare or other philosophers (sometimes incorrectly). She appears highly flirtatious and is very popular among other girls, not only for her passionate mannerisms, but because she is also surprisingly reliable. If she is aware someone may be in a bad mood or feels sad, she will try to encourage them or help them feel better.

When by herself, her "quirks" seem to lessen, if not vanish entirely at times. She appears to be aware of how she can come off to others; sometimes she struggles to have time to herself due to having so many fans and is aware that she likes certain things that don't fit her "character". She is even able to increase her actress's personality if she feels it is necessary.

Though she appears very intelligent, she can often be just as airheaded as Kokoro and Hagumi - such as mistakenly assuming the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was a woman, or repeatedly attempting to push on a door that could only be opened by pulling. Her catchphrase is "fleeting", although when other people question her about what it means, she does not answer clearly.

Despite appearing to be very prideful, Kaoru struggled with self-esteem problems in the past and created her princely persona to flatter other girls so they may never feel the same way. She also used to be shyer and lamented the fact that she was not strong enough to protect Chisato from their classmates, believing she was an evil and mean person because of one of the roles she acted in.

#### Kaoru's Custom Tour of Duty
Kaoru is a very hard bot, which means her skill point is set to 80. She is 80% accurate when firing. Her reaction time is 0.25 seconds and she is more sensitive to footsteps. She has no attack delay.

She has 50 (Ok) points of teamwork and 75 (Good) points of bravery. Kaoru has moderate teamwork. She sometimes follows the player's commands. She groups with teammates if he lacks sufficient money.

Kaoru is an aggressive bot. She will not retreat if she spots a few enemies. She only retreats after facing a large group of enemies. In bomb defusal maps, she prefers to strike the Terrorists rather than camping at a bombsite.

Kaoru uses Rifle template, which means his top priority weapon is Maverick M4A1 Carbine.

Her voice pitch is set to the standard 100.

#### Ako's Background

She admires Yukina and her older sister Tomoe, and is best friends with Rinko, whom she calls "Rin-rin". She is also classmates with both Asuka and Rokka.

#### Ako's Personality
Ako is shown to have chuunibyou tendencies and illusions of grandeur and magical powers. Rinko suspects this is the result of her playing online games frequently. She enjoys playing the role while keeping a realistic mentality. However, she tends to sometimes stumble on her words when she's not sure what to say while doing this.

Ako is a cheerful and noisy girl. Although she's only two years younger than the other Roselia members, Ako is treated like the kid sister by the other characters due to her childlike appearance and personality. She is also a very hardworking and passionate drummer, though she may be bad at schoolwork.

Ako often wonders how she can be a "cooler" person, and sometimes feels inadequate compared to her other bandmates; however, as the story goes on, she becomes more confident and both Yukina and Sayo, who initially scoffed or ignored her ideas sometimes, also come to understand her more and get used to her chuunibyou side.

#### Ako's Custom Tour of Duty
Ako is a hard bot, which means her skill point is set to 75. She is 75% accurate when firing. Her reaction time is 0.25 seconds and she is more sensitive to footsteps. She has no attack delay.

Ako's teamwork is 50%, which in the OK category. She rarely follows the player's commands and always stays away from teammates. She only regroups if he has low money in reserve.

Ako is a quite aggressive bot. She will not retreat after spotting some enemies but retreats after spotting a large group of assailants. After several seconds, she will strike back.

Ako uses RifleT weapon preference. She prefers to purchase the Maverick M4A1 Carbine, but will swap it for an CV-47 if she finds one dropped by a Terrorist. 

Her voice pitch is set to 119, the highest level.

#### Kanon's Personality
Sensible and responsible, Kanon is one of the members within Hello, Happy World! that manages to keep the band running smoothly, although she is likely to space out and start thinking about jellyfish. She is fairly shy and easily flustered, and can become a nervous wreck at the drop of a hat and start crying if she feels overwhelmed.

#### Masuki's Personality

She is a straightforward but enthusiastic girl with a passionate heart, and values her friendship with the other RAISE A SUILEN members. She can be quite playful with her bandmates, and especially likes teasing Chiyu. She loves cooking, as well as talking about it, and even works part-time at a ramen store called "Ramen Ginga".

She is a very skilled drummer, however, when she gets too immersed, she tends to fluster the other band members with her difficult improvisation performances, which made it difficult for her to join a band previously. Because of her violent and impulsive playstyle, she is called a mad dog (狂犬).

Masuki admires Maya a lot and even knew of her before she became Pastel Palettes' drummer. She even tends to mimic Maya's speaking style when she speaks with her. Likewise, Maya also admires Masuki and calls her "King".

She is also good friends with Tomoe because they're both older sisters and drummers, and with Moca due to her being the self-proclaimed number #1 fan of Yamabuki Bakery. She and Rimi are also classmates with Kokoro.

Saaya is the oldest of three children in her family; she has a younger brother named Jun, and a younger sister named Sana. Saaya's family owns the Yamabuki Bakery, at which she helps out, even during the school term.

Saaya used to play in a girls' band called CHiSPA when she was in middle school, but quit because she didn't want to burden her bandmates and her family due to an incident that happened before an important performance. But thanks to Kasumi, who never gave up on her, and her mother's support, she regained her passion for music and her desire to perform in a band, thus became the last member of Poppin'Party to join.

#### Saaya's Personality
A kind, empathetic and hardworking person who cares deeply about her friends and family, Saaya often lends an ear to the people around her. She is generally level-headed and easygoing, and is like an "older sister" to the other girls, always willing to help them out in hard times. In addition to this, Saaya is the most mature member of Poppin'Party, and good at dealing with kids. Because of her kind nature, she has a hard time saying "no" to her friends or their requests, such as helping Hagumi to study.

#### Saaya's Custom Tour of Duty

#### Tae's Background
Hanazono Tae is a second-year student at Hanasakigawa Girls' High School and the lead guitarist of Poppin'Party. The other members call her O-Tae.

She is a huge lover of music and used to work part-time at SPACE before it shut down after the final live, which Poppin'Party also played in.

Tae lives with her parents and 20 rabbits. She has considerable skill with the guitar, since she started playing it when she was in elementary school.

One day, when Tae had to finish her home economics assignment with Kasumi after school, she started interacting with her and taught her how to play the basic guitar chords.

Tae at first doubted Kasumi's idea to audition at SPACE when she told her about it, because the band needed a considerable skill level to pass. But when Kasumi performed for the first time in front of their friends and family with Arisa, Rimi, and Tae herself, Tae realized how much fun she had performing with them, which led to her joining Kasumi's Poppin'Party as its fourth member. Adding to this, Tae was impressed by their own performance and believed in their potential.

#### Tae's Personality
A relaxed individual who lives at her own pace, Tae sometimes surprises the people around her with her keen observations and understanding of music. She carries a sense of knowing in her discussions with others, while always keeping an optimistic outlook on a situation. However, she is also slightly airheaded like her mother, and tends to make or say weird remarks befitting to the situation at hand.

Tae loves both rabbits and hamburg steaks and is constantly thinking about them, sometimes to the point of daydreaming and losing focus during a conversation. She loves rabbits so much to the point where she started doing imitations of her rabbits during the New Year party's talent show. In addition to this, Tae has compared other people, such as Rimi and Arisa to rabbits (Rimi because of her overall nature, and Arisa because her twin tails remind Tae of a rabbit's ears). She affectionately refers to one of her rabbits, Odd-Eye (nicknamed Occhan in Japanese and Oddie in the localized version), as her boyfriend.

#### Tae's Custom Tour of Duty
Tae is a very hard bot, which means her skill point is set to 80. She is 80% accurate when firing. Her reaction time is 0.25 seconds and she is more sensitive to footsteps. She has no attack delay.

Same as Masuki and Saaya, her teamwork and bravery are also set to 75 each. 

Tae uses the Punch template, which means her top priority weapon is the Bullpup. She does not use the low-power scope like other bots using the Bullpup.

Her voice pitch is set to 104, slightly higher than the standard voice.

#### Aya's Background
Maruyama Aya is a third-year student at Hanasakigawa Girls' High School and the leader and vocalist of Pastel*Palettes. She also works part-time at the fast-food store with Kanon.

Aya has always admired idols ever since she was young, and the reason she wanted to become an idol was because of the idol group Marmalade's lead, Ayumi. Aya then spent three years being a trainee idol before she was chosen to become the lead singer for Pastel*Palettes.

#### Aya's Personality
On the outside, Aya is very cheerful, high-spirited, and bubbly. She is also very nice and has always been in love with idols. She is unselfish in her pursuits, helping others for the sake of being kind.

Deep down, however, she is a sensitive girl who suffers from a complex stemming from her desire to be noticed. Adding to this, she does not wear her disguise outside because she wants to get noticed and even looks up constantly what people think of her on the internet. She gets worked up easily and tends to cry a lot, thus her improvisation skills are poor and she tends to mess up during her MC duties. She also has a senpai-kouhai relationship with Kasumi and often frets over it, trying her best to look and act like an "admirable, reliable senpai".

Aya works hard in order to become an idol she can be proud of and is very determined about her goal and passion despite her shortcomings. She is also very knowledgeable about certain things, such as taking the perfect selfie, and is shown to constantly practice this. She also likes coming up with different "idol poses" which she's usually proud of, despite the fact that people tease her for them (or misunderstand them, just like in Eve's case).

#### Aya's Custom Tour of Duty
Aya is a very hard bot, which means her skill point is set to 80. She is 80% accurate when firing. Her reaction time is 0.25 seconds and she is more sensitive to footsteps. She has no attack delay.

Her teamwork is set to 85 (Good). She frequently follows the player's commands and usually stays together with teammates. Her bravery is set to high, at 100 points. She will never retreat even when spotting a large group of enemies. In bomb defusal maps, she prefers to strike the Terrorists rather than camp at a bombsite.

Aya uses the Spray template.

Same as Saaya, her voice pitch is 115.

#### Lisa's Background
Imai Lisa is a third-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and Roselia's bassist.

She follows gyaru fashion, but keeps her interest in amigurumi secret, since it does not match her image. She is a proficient bassist, wowing the other Roselia members in her audition, and is a great cook as well as a baker[2].

She is best friends and next-door neighbors with Yukina, and has known her ever since they were little. Outside of the band, she is also friends with Moca, who is her coworker at her part-time job at the convenience store.

#### Lisa's Personality
Lisa is a friendly and lively girl who appears mature and calm. Despite her appearance, Lisa acts as the mediator in tense situations, and takes care of everyone well. It's because of her that Roselia is able to continue to stick together despite the contrasting members personalities and disagreements at times. She often chides the others if she feels necessary, bringing balance to the group.

Lisa is very caring in nature, and is able to notice when a friend is troubled, usually being the first to try and help. She does her best to do what she can, sometimes to a fault, where she'll put her all into something regardless of her own feelings. Adding to her caring nature, she sometimes calls herself an "onee-san", but the other characters have also compared her to a mother at times.

Despite her skills and proficiency as a bassist Lisa believes she is the least skilled member of Roselia, and can get quite sentimental at times as well. She easily cries when her friends, or especially Yukina, reaffirm just how much she is needed in the band or in general. However as time goes on, she becomes more confident and is able to call herself a proud member of Roselia.

#### Lisa's Custom Tour of Duty
Lisa is a hard bot, which means her skill point is set to 75. She is 75% accurate when firing. Her reaction time is 0.25 seconds and she is more sensitive to footsteps. She has no attack delay.

She has 100 (High) points of teamwork and 50 (Ok) points of bravery. She always follow the player's commands and stays close to teammates. She will retreat after spotting a large group of Terrorists and waits for them to come to her position. In bomb defusal maps, she prefers to strike the Terrorists rather than camping at a bombsite.

Lisa uses the Punch template.

Same as Saaya and Aya, her voice pitch is 115.

Ushigome Rimi is a second-year student at Hanasakigawa Girls' High School and the bassist and composer for Poppin'Party. The other band members call her both Rimi and Rimi-rin.

Outside of the band, she is friends with Misaki, and similarly to Himari, one of Kaoru's fangirls. She is also a huge fan of the Yamabuki Bakery, and especially loves their chocolate cornets.

#### Rimi's Background
Rimi's pink bass guitar is a hand-me-down from her older sister Yuri, who is two years older than her and also the lead vocalist of the band Glitter*Green.

During Rimi's high school entrance ceremony, she heard Kasumi's self-introduction that was filled with boundless optimism, and this sparked her interest in her. Though Rimi wanted to change her cowardly and shy personality, she had initially been unable to do anything about it.

At first, Rimi declined Kasumi's invitation to become a member of the band Poppin'Party because of her stage fright, but everything changed when she became inspired by Kasumi who sang onstage at SPACE until Glitter*Green, who were late because of the storm, arrived. She eventually found her confidence to overcome her stage fright and managed to perform with Kasumi and Arisa. After the show, she finally decided to join Kasumi's band as its third member and bassist.

#### Rimi's Personality
Rimi is a shy and reserved girl who admires her older sister and often gushes over her. She tends to compare herself to the others frequently, and wishes she could be more confident and be able to "speak up" more often. Rimi is cute and sweet-natured, and often blushes when flustered, but at times can be very determined and strong as well.

As Rimi used to live in the Kansai region, her Kansai dialect sometimes slips into her speech when she stumbles on her sentences or is very nervous; she is a bit embarrassed of this.

#### Rimi's Custom Tour of Duty
Rimi is a hard bot, which means her skill point is set to 75. She is 75% accurate when firing. Her reaction time is 0.25 seconds and she is more sensitive to footsteps. She has no attack delay.

Same as Lisa, she has 100 (High) points of teamwork and 50 (Ok) points of bravery.

Rimi uses Rifle template.

Her voice pitch is set to 118, the high level.

#### Rinko's Background
Shirokane Rinko is a third-year student and the student council president of Hanasakigawa Girls' High School, as well as the last member to join Roselia as their keyboardist. She is a very talented keyboardist who has played the piano ever since she was 5-years-old, and prior to joining Roselia, had even won a music contest.

She is very shy, and is at first scared of the idea of performing in a live concert. She is also the band's costume designer and sews their outfits all by herself.

Her hobbies are reading and playing online games, the latter through which she met her best friend, Ako, who also calls her "Rin-rin".

#### Rinko's Personality
Socially awkward, Rinko is a shy and asocial girl who was initially too frightened to speak in front of others, let alone perform before them. She has a tendency to stammer when speaking, and usually keeps quiet until she feels comfortable.

When she is set on or passionate about something, she does so with conviction, like piano or online games. Rinko also tends to get very excited about her passions, to the point where when she was explaining how Neo Fantasy Online worked to the other Roselia members, she was speaking in an alarming speed.

#### Rinko's Custom Tour of Duty
Rimi is a hard bot, which means her skill point is set to 75. She is 75% accurate when firing. Her reaction time is 0.25 seconds and she is more sensitive to footsteps. She has no attack delay.

Same as Lisa and Rimi, she has 100 (High) points of teamwork and 50 (Ok) points of bravery.

She uses Shotgun template.
