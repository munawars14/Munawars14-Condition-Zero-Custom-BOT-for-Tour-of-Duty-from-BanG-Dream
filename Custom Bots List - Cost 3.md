## Overview
There are 10 Tour of Duty CT bots under Cost 3 category.

On Easy and Normal difficulty, they are unlocked after the player finished 8 maps (at 10 reputation points), while on Hard and Expert they are available from the beginning (they technically need 6 and 1 points respectively at these levels, but the starting reputation point level covers the costs). Three reputation points are needed to hire each of them. 10 of them uses Hard and VeryHard skill templates.

The order of the top weapons on the list becomes the bot's top priority.

#### Kaoru's Background
Seta Kaoru is a third-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and the guitarist of Hello, Happy World!
She is very popular with ladies, whom she dubs her "little kittens" (子猫ーちゃん, koneko-chan). Himari and Rimi in particular have a tendency of blushing in her presence.

Outside of the band, she is also Chisato's childhood friend, and their parents are good friends as well.

#### Kaoru's Personality
A flamboyant actress, Kaoru has an extravagant personality. She is rather pretentious and bombastic, having a tendency to use impressive-sounding words to the point of sounding foreign and hard to understand. She views herself as a prince and sees other girls as princesses, while quoting Shakespeare or other philosophers (sometimes incorrectly). She appears highly flirtatious and is very popular among other girls, not only for her passionate mannerisms, but because she is also surprisingly reliable. If she is aware someone may be in a bad mood or feels sad, she will try to encourage them or help them feel better.

When by herself, her "quirks" seem to lessen, if not vanish entirely at times. She appears to be aware of how she can come off to others; sometimes she struggles to have time to herself due to having so many fans and is aware that she likes certain things that don't fit her "character". She is even able to increase her actress's personality if she feels it is necessary.

Though she appears very intelligent, she can often be just as airheaded as Kokoro and Hagumi - such as mistakenly assuming the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was a woman, or repeatedly attempting to push on a door that could only be opened by pulling. Her catchphrase is "fleeting", although when other people question her about what it means, she does not answer clearly.

Despite appearing to be very prideful, Kaoru struggled with self-esteem problems in the past and created her princely persona to flatter other girls so they may never feel the same way. She also used to be shyer and lamented the fact that she was not strong enough to protect Chisato from their classmates, believing she was an evil and mean person because of one of the roles she acted in.

#### Kaoru's Custom Tour of Duty
Kaoru is a very hard bot, which means her skill point is set to 80. She is 80% accurate when firing. Her reaction time is 0.25 seconds and she is more sensitive to footsteps. She has no attack delay.

She has 50 (Ok) points of teamwork and 75 (Good) points of bravery. Kaoru has moderate teamwork. She sometimes follows the player's commands. She groups with teammates if he lacks sufficient money.

Kaoru is an aggressive bot. She will not retreat if she spots a few enemies. She only retreats after facing a large group of enemies. In bomb defusal maps, she prefers to strike the Terrorists rather than camping at a bombsite.

Kaoru uses Rifle template, which means his top priority weapon is Maverick M4A1 Carbine.

Her voice pitch is set to the standard 100.

#### Ako's Background
Udagawa Ako is a first-year student at Haneoka Girls' High School and the drummer for Roselia.

She admires Yukina and her older sister Tomoe, and is best friends with Rinko, whom she calls "Rin-rin". She is also classmates with both Asuka and Rokka.

#### Ako's Personality
Ako is shown to have chuunibyou tendencies and illusions of grandeur and magical powers. Rinko suspects this is the result of her playing online games frequently. She enjoys playing the role while keeping a realistic mentality. However, she tends to sometimes stumble on her words when she's not sure what to say while doing this.

Ako is a cheerful and noisy girl. Although she's only two years younger than the other Roselia members, Ako is treated like the kid sister by the other characters due to her childlike appearance and personality. She is also a very hardworking and passionate drummer, though she may be bad at schoolwork.

Ako often wonders how she can be a "cooler" person, and sometimes feels inadequate compared to her other bandmates; however, as the story goes on, she becomes more confident and both Yukina and Sayo, who initially scoffed or ignored her ideas sometimes, also come to understand her more and get used to her chuunibyou side.

#### Ako's Custom Tour of Duty
Ako is a hard bot, which means her skill point is set to 75. She is 75% accurate when firing. Her reaction time is 0.25 seconds and she is more sensitive to footsteps. She has no attack delay.

Ako's teamwork is 50%, which in the OK category. She rarely follows the player's commands and always stays away from teammates. She only regroups if he has low money in reserve.

Ako is a quite aggressive bot. She will not retreat after spotting some enemies but retreats after spotting a large group of assailants. After several seconds, she will strike back.

Ako uses RifleT weapon preference. She prefers to purchase the Maverick M4A1 Carbine, but will swap it for an CV-47 if she finds one dropped by a Terrorist. 

Her voice pitch is set to 119, the highest level.
