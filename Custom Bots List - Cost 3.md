## Overview
There are 13 Tour of Duty CT bots under Cost 3 category and 4 bots will switch to the terrorist team on Hard and Expert difficulties.

On Easy and Normal difficulty, they are unlocked after the player finished 8 maps (at 10 reputation points), while on Hard and Expert they are available from the beginning (they technically need 6 and 1 points respectively at these levels, but the starting reputation point level covers the costs). Three reputation points are needed to hire each of them. 10 of them uses Hard and VeryHard skill templates.

The order of the top weapons on the list becomes the bot's top priority.

# Tactics
<ul>
<li>When hiring cost 3 bots, hire 1 or more bots below first because they have better skill (80 instead of 75).</li>
<ul>
<li>Shirokane Rinko, she might be a good choice in large maps such as Cobblestone and Aztec in lower difficulties.</li>
<li>Seta Kaoru or Matsubara Kanon, they can be deployed to firing enemies in medium or long range.</li>
<li>Yamabuki Saaya</li>
<ul>
<li>In Chateau, there is a challenge that require player to eliminate enemies using M249. If the player struggle to purchase expensive M249, using Saaya as teammate might be a good idea. Follow her, and when she dies, pick up her M249 for free.
<ul>
<li>It's best to hire Saaya only maps with close quarter combat as bots with the M249 will fire in full auto regardless of it's range; limiting their accuracy to first few shots at long range.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Hanazono Tae, she can be deployed to firing enemies in medium and melee range.</li>
<li>Maruyama Aya, so it's better for players to hire her only in melee type territorial (Office, Tides, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

# Trivia
<ul>
<li>Unlike the original Tour of Duty, none of the bots use Tactical Shield and stats of bots like <a href="https://counterstrike.fandom.com/wiki/Maverick">Maverick</a>.</li>
<li>Udagawa Ako has the highest pitch among all Tour of Duty bots.</li>
<Li>Only Ako and Saaya use the exclusive character, Spetsnaz.
