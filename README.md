## A. About Tour of Duty
According to <b>Jess Cliffe</b>, Tour of Duty was partly inspired by sports games.

There are 6 tours of duty in this game mode and each tour of duty consists of 3 different maps (all maps use their Condition Zero games versions). Completing one tour of duty unlocks the next tour of duty.

Each map has one to 3 challenges that the player must achieve in order to win the map depending on the difficulty. The player also has to win 3 rounds and lead the opponents by 2 rounds in order to win.

There is no score limit. The player team is considered defeated if the opposing team has won more than 3 rounds consecutively and the player is required to restart the entire challenge for the map.

The player starts each match with $10000 money. Unlike normal multiplayer games, opening the buy menu and the pause menu pauses the game.

The difficulties are Easy, Normal, Hard, and Expert. Increasing the difficulty increases the power of the Terrorists and the difficulty of the challenges, and friendly fire is turned on on Hard and Expert. Each difficulty tracks its own progress and do not influence others.

<b>Counter-Terrorists</b><br>
The player always plays as Counter-Terrorists.

The player may choose up to 5 different bot teammates to help. The bots are divided in to five groups by cost; Cost 1, Cost 2, Cost 3, Cost 4, and Cost 5. The bots are only available if the player unlocks them with reputation points. Counter-terrorist bots will <i>not defuse the bomb</i> or <i>rescue hostages</i> unless the player is dead.

<b>Terrorists</b><br>
The Terrorists will oppose your way. They will plant the bomb at one of the bombsites in the Bomb defusal scenario and protect the hostages from being rescued in the Hostage rescue scenario. They are divided into 8 teams of increasing difficulties.

When the player gains reputation points, the amount of enemies on maps within the same tour of duty will increase to balance out the player's increased amount and power of teammates.
